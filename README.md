## About
The app offers a variety of tools for taking notes, including: texts, lists, images and audio. Text from images can be extracted using optical character recognition and voice recordings can be transcribed. The interface allows for a single-column view or a multi-column view. Notes can be color-coded and labels can be applied for organization. Later updates have added functionality to pin notes and to collaborate on notes with other Keep users in real-time. Users can choose between a single-column view and a multi-column view. Notes can be categorized using labels, with a list of labels in the app's navigation bar.
